*dhcp-display-device*
===================

Project: Nemesis. An Arduino project which detects and displays a dhcp address.


Our goal is to build a sturdy and simple-to-use device that will detect and display a dhcp-assigned IP address when plugged into a network. Designed for techs installing networked equipment such as ATM machines, this device will help determine if a given ethernet wire is receiving valid addresses via dhcp and if there is internet connectivity. We plan to open source all code and hardware designs, including the final 3D-printable casing. The final product should be cheaper to manufacture than existing $200 solutions.
