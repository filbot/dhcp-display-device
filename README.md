Mike, this is where you use your lingustic paintbrush to get people excited about this product. My thought is that we opensource the code and the 3d printer box design files in this repo so others can benfit and we can benifit from their PRs if they submit any. If we want to see if this project has legs as a product for sale, we can do that as well. They can either build it themselves or buy the complete project from us.
